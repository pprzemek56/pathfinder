## Introduction
Pathfinder is a web application designed to help users better understand how pathfinding algorithms work. The main goal of this project is to provide an interactive environment where users can easily create custom paths or obstacles and observe the behavior of different algorithms.

I was inspired to create this project after implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in a game I developed earlier [Game of Lines - repo](https://github.com/pprzemek56/GameOfLines). This experience sparked my interest in pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to create a tool that would make these algorithms more accessible and understandable to others.

In the future, I plan to enhance the project's scientific value by providing detailed explanations and insights into the code, allowing users to understand why and how a chosen algorithm determines the optimal path. This will transform Pathfinder into an even more comprehensive and educational tool for those interested in the inner workings of pathfinding algorithms.
Also want to add more pathfinding algorithms.

## Features

### Current Features

- Interactive Visualization: Users can interactively create custom paths or obstacles on the grid and watch as the selected pathfinding algorithm finds the optimal path in real-time. This helps users visualize and understand how different algorithms navigate and make decisions.
- Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms: The application supports various pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS). Users can compare the performance and results of different algorithms.
- Step-by-Step Execution:  Users can control the speed of the algorithm execution, pause, and step through the process, allowing them to observe and analyze each step of the chosen pathfinding algorithm.
### Upcoming Features

These features are currently under development or planned for future releases:

- Add more pathfinding algorithms: E.g.: Dijkstra's algorithm, A* algorithm, Bellman-Ford algorithm, Johnson Algorithm, Floyd-Warshall Algorithm, IDA Algorithm*, Artificial Intelligence Algorithm.
- Customizable Grid: Users can easily customize the size and complexity of the grid, creating a wide range of scenarios and challenges for the pathfinding algorithms.
- Algorithm Performance Metrics: The application provides performance metrics such as the time taken, the number of nodes visited, and path length for each algorithm execution, helping users to understand the strengths and weaknesses of different algorithms in various situations.
- Tutorial and Documentation: The application includes a built-in tutorial and comprehensive documentation to help users understand the basics of pathfinding algorithms, their use cases, and how to use the Pathfinder application effectively.
- Automated Domain Server Configuration: This feature simplifies the process of setting up and configuring a domain server by automating common tasks and providing an intuitive user interface.

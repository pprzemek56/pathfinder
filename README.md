## Pathfinder

is a web application project, which allow user to better understand how the pathfinding algorithms work. 
This project is currently under development, and I believe it represents my best work as a software developer.

## Introduction
Pathfinder is a web application designed to help users better understand how pathfinding algorithms work. The main goal of this project is to provide an interactive environment where users can easily create custom paths or obstacles and observe the behavior of different algorithms.

I was inspired to create this project after implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in a game I developed earlier [Game of Lines - repo](https://github.com/pprzemek56/GameOfLines). This experience sparked my interest in pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to create a tool that would make these algorithms more accessible and understandable to others.

In the future, I plan to enhance the project's scientific value by providing detailed explanations and insights into the code, allowing users to understand why and how a chosen algorithm determines the optimal path. This will transform Pathfinder into an even more comprehensive and educational tool for those interested in the inner workings of pathfinding algorithms.
Also want to add more pathfinding algorithms.

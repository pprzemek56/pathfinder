## Introduction
Pathfinder is a web application designed to help users better understand how pathfinding algorithms work. The main goal of this project is to provide an interactive environment where users can easily create custom paths or obstacles and observe the behavior of different algorithms.

I was inspired to create this project after implementing the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm in a game I developed earlier [Game of Lines - repo](https://github.com/pprzemek56/GameOfLines). This experience sparked my interest in pathfinding algorithms, and I wanted to create a tool that would make these algorithms more accessible and understandable to others.

In the future, I plan to enhance the project's scientific value by providing detailed explanations and insights into the code, allowing users to understand why and how a chosen algorithm determines the optimal path. This will transform Pathfinder into an even more comprehensive and educational tool for those interested in the inner workings of pathfinding algorithms.
Also want to add more pathfinding algorithms.

## Features
- Interactive Visualization: Users can interactively create custom paths or obstacles on the grid and watch as the selected pathfinding algorithm finds the optimal path in real-time. This helps users visualize and understand how different algorithms navigate and make decisions.
- Multiple Pathfinding Algorithms: The application supports various pathfinding algorithms such as Breadth-First Search (BFS), Depth-First Search (DFS), Dijkstra Algorithm, A* Agorithm, Greedy Best-First Search Algorithm. Users can compare the performance and results of different algorithms.
- Step-by-Step Execution:  Users can control the speed of the algorithm execution, pause, and step through the process, allowing them to observe and analyze each step of the chosen pathfinding algorithm.
- Debug mode, where user can follow step by step algorithm execution thanks to real time communication chanels.
- Web application successfully hosted on AWS Cloud Service.
